**WEBSITE AUTHOR'S NOTES:**
  + June 25, 2023:
      After some testing on different phones, I have discovered that due the 'adjust volume' feature encounters some errors on iPhone and does not work. I will try to fix this problem later on.
      On laptops and Androids, the volume adjustment feature seems to work fine.
